          One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

          The origin of french fries is uncertain. According to one tradition, they first appeared in France, where they were likely a snack sold by street peddlers. However, in more recent years Belgium has been cited as the birthplace. The source of the name is also disputed. One oft-repeated claim is that a U.S. soldier who tasted the dish while in the Belgian city of Namur during World War I coined the term.
